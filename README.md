Detailed Explanation of the Game
This game is designed to simulate a detective scenario where you need to find the thief who stole the Spoonmaker’s Diamond from Topkapı Palace. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the game and how to play it:

Game Story
The game starts with a news headline stating that the Spoonmaker’s Diamond has been stolen from Topkapı Palace. The thief replaced the spoon-shaped diamond with a round one. As Detective [Your Name], you are tasked with finding the thief among 1000 visitors who visited the palace on the day of the theft. You have a list of these visitors sorted by the time they entered the room where the diamond was kept. You believe that everyone who saw the diamond after the thief will describe it as round, helping you narrow down the suspect list.

How to Play
1-Start the Game: The game begins by generating a random number between 1 and 1000, representing the thief’s position in the visitor list. You will be prompted to enter your name, which will be used throughout the game.
2-Game Story Introduction: The game will narrate the story, setting the scene for your detective mission. It explains that you have a maximum of 10 attempts to find the thief.
3-Making Guesses: You will be asked to guess the position of the thief in the visitor list. Each guess should be a number between 1 and 1000.
4-Feedback on Guesses: After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  If your guess is correct, you will be congratulated, and the game will end.
  If your guess is too high, you will be told that the diamond was round, indicating the thief’s position is lower.
  If your guess is too low, you will be told that the diamond was spoon-shaped, indicating the thief’s position is higher.
5-Repeat Until Correct or Attempts Exhausted: You continue making guesses based on the feedback until you either find the thief or use up all 10 attempts. If you exceed the maximum number of attempts, the game will reveal the correct position of the thief.

This game not only provides an engaging way to practice logical thinking and problem-solving but also serves as a practical application of the binary search algorithm. By narrowing down the possible positions of the thief with each guess, you effectively learn how binary search works in a fun and interactive manner.
